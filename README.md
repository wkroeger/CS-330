Computer Graphics and Visualizations

How do I approach designing software?
I typically start with an outline of a project and the basic structure of each required function and how they'll connect with each other. 
Depending on how complex it is, this can be in my head, on paper, or an actual UML diagram.

How do I approach developing programs?
I constantly run and re-run the program after making small incremental changes to ensure that I haven't broken anything. Most of my actual progress comes after what seems like hours of tediously reworking a solution until I get the output I want from the program. I also try to ensure I have plenty of time before I begin even small items since most of my time will probably involve reading documentation or help forums to create my own efficient solution.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
The biggest goal I have with my computer science degree is to help people leverage automation and AI to make smarter decisions faster. Understanding computer graphics can help me if I need to create a GUI or animations for a program, but it can also help me troubleshoot graphical errors that occur within other programs.
